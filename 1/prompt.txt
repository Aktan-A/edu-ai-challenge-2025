Hello! Could you please help me select a database for my project:
- Social platform with millions of users
- Need to store profiles, posts, and connections between users
- High data read speed required
- Expected 80% read operations, 20% write operations
-Scalability is important as the user base grows

Please use the chain-of-thought reasoning so that I could understand why you picked a specific type of database.
